Chess game with game logic written in Ruby (in the lib/assets/chess folder).

Built on top of rails to use Rails' MVC to deliver views to the browser.

UI built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX.

Uses pusher to provide realtime updates of the current game board.

Users can play against one another!  When the opponent makes a move, the board automatically updates thanks to Pusher.
